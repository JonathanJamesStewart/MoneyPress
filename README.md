This is my custom finance tracker application.

It will include a combination of services that I have not been able to find amongst other
finance tracking apps. The initial goal is to simply be able to scan receipts, have the
app parse the receipts and classify each item by custom categories. From there the user
will be able to analyze who is spending what and where by flexible graphs to give different
viewpoints of their spending habits.

Some optimistic goals of this app is to include finance account synchronization, household
spending habits per person, and others to be added.
